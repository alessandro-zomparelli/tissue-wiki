Installation
============

#. Start Blender. Go to "Edit" and then "Preferences"
#. Open the "Add-ons" preferences
#. Click "install..." and point Blender at the downloaded zip file (on OSX it may have extracted the zip automatically, that won't work, so you have to zip the extracted folder again)
#. You may see now two different versions of Tissue, activate only the second one and ignore the first one


Introduction
============

Tissue is an add-on fro Blender
This is an example reStructuredText document that starts at the very top
with a title and a sub-title. There is one primary header, Introduction.
There is one example subheading below.
The document is just plain text so it is easily readable even before
being converted to HTML, man page, PDF or other formats.

Subheading
----------

The basic syntax is not that different from Markdown, but it also
has many more powerful features that Markdown doesn't have. We aren't
taking advantage of those yet though.

- Bullet points
- Are intuitive
- And simple too
