**Intallation**

For installing Tissue Add-on in Blender read <i>Installation of a 3rd party Add-on</i> on [Blender's Manual](http://www.blender.org/manual/extensions/python/add_ons.html).
After installation, you should find _Tissue_ Tab in the 3D Viewport Toolshelf.

**Tessellate**

_Tessellate_ tool allows you to copy a selected object (Component) on the faces of the active object (Generator), adapting its bounding box to the shape of quad-faces.
Once the Tessellate button was pressed, then more options will appear in the Operator parameters.
_Update_ allows you to update the active the Tessellated mesh according to Component and Generator changes. You can also change the parameters of tessellation.
