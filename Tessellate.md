The settings for the Tessellation can be defined at beginning:

Or also in a second moment from the panle in the _Object Data_ section of the _Properties_ frame:

The main settings are:

### Animatable

Manually refresh the Tessellation reloading the changes to both Base and Component objects.

### BASE

(Object supported are Mesh, Curve, Surface, Text)

### COMPONENT

(Object supported are Mesh, Curve, Surface, Text)

### Use Modifiers

Apply Modifiers and Shape Keys, otherwise just the original mesh data is used.
