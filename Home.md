### Contribute
Please help me keeping Tissue stable and updated, report any issue here: https://github.com/alessandro-zomparelli/tissue/issues

Tissue is free and open-source. I really think that this is the power of Blender and I wanted to give my small contribution to it.
If you like my work and you want to help to continue the development of Tissue, please consider to make a small donation. Any small contribution is really appreciated, thanks! :-D
